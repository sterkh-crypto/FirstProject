This Python program creates a Tkinter-based sign-in system for students and faculty and stores their information in a SQLite database.
Users enter their ID, name, major, position (student/faculty), and (for faculty) a PIN. The program then inserts the sign-in data into the SignIns table.

After signing in, students get a window with tools like a tuition calculator and lists of majors and advisors. Faculty get options to view all users, update a user, or delete a user from the database.

It uses multiple Tkinter windows for different tasks and performs database operations such as inserting, selecting, updating, and deleting records.
